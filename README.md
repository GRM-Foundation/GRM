# GRM
Government Reference Modello is the core GRM Foundation project.

We maintain an .archimate file containing the OMG's Goverment Reference Model and other .archimate files for GRM (unofficial) localizations. 
For example, the GRM.it.archimate model contains the Italian localization of the GRM and the GRM.en.archimate file contains the original model in the English language.

Everybody can contribute adding new localizations.

In addition, at the GRM Foundation, we maintain State-based instances of the GRM model (both in English and State mother tongue), based on the specific law systems of the different States. 
Those State-specific models are stored in State-specific .archimate files managed as State-specific branches of the project/repository. 
For example, the ITA branch of this project/repository captures the Italian specific goverment enterprise architecture based on the Sourceses of the Italian legal systems. Into the ITA branch you can find the GRM-ITA.it.archimate file -containing the model in Italian- and the GRM-ITA.en.archimate file -containing the same model in English-.
