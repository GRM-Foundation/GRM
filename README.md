# GRM
Government Reference Modello is the core GRM Foundation project.
We maintain an .archimate file containing the OMG's Goverment Reference Model and (unofficial) localizations. 
For example, the IT-GRM.archimate model contains the Italian localization of the GRM.

Everybody can contribute adding new localizations.

In addition, at the GRM Foundation, we maintain State-based instances of the GRM model (both in English and State mother tongue), based on the specific law systems of the different States. 
Those State-specific models are stored in State-specific .archimate files managed as State-specific branches of the project/repository. 
For example, the GRM.it branch of this project/repository captures the Italian specific goverment enterprise architecture based on Sourceses of the Italian legal systems. Into this branch you can find the GRM-IT.it.archimate file -containing the model in Italian- and the GRM-EN.it.archimate file -containing the same model in English-.
